# Async one liner (or so) functions

> Some examples of async utility functions, to handle things like
> mapping an array using an async callback, awaiting for a certain
> timeout before invoking a function etc.
>
> The functions are just a few lines long, and are written in Typescript.
> They are not complete - there is no error handling, just to name one -
> but they might be a starting point to build something more robust.

> Let me know if you have any suggestion :)
